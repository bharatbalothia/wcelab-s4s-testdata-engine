# S4S Test Data Generator

Test data generator for Sterling 4 Scarce Supply System

This test data generation uses [LEGO inventory data](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) to create a realistic inventory test data set.

- It maps original data's part number to test data's part number
- It maps one of the original data's attribute to test data's location id
- It then aggregates by part number and location id to calculate inventory position
